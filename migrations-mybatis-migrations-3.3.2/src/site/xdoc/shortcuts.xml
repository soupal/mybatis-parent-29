    <section name="Command Shortcuts">
      <p>Any of the commands can be executed with only the first few (unambiguous) characters of their name.</p>

      <p>For example, the <code>status</code> command can be shortened to:</p>

      <source>/home/cbegin/testdb$ migrate sta</source>

      <p>Or even just:</p>

      <source>/home/cbegin/testdb$ migrate st</source>

      <p>If you script migrations using unix shell scripts or Windows batch files, be sure to always use the full name
      for safety. That way, if the shortcut becomes ambiguous in the future, your script will still function.</p>
